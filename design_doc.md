### BattleSystem

Brainstorm of ways to improve etrian odyssey core battle system
* Slightly repetitive on lower level/floor enemies
  * Have a feature where you have the choice of auto-winning battle (from mother2)
  * Increase speed of encounters
* Hiding of turn system
  * I like FFX system where many skills deal with fitting as many of your own actions 
    while preventing the enemies actions
  * Speed mechanic is sort of cloudy because heavy armor slows you down but there is 
  no indicator
* I want the player to manage their "advantage" state more like in chrono trigger
  * in chrono trigger, if a character dies, you need to spend all your tempo reviving and healing
  * the characters synergize
* Character synergies and class ideas
  * EO3 has the best character synergies. The core concept is that your abilities
  use data or affect other party members either directly or indirectly like from the dragoon who
  distracts and protects party members by influencing the enemy
  * ninja is one of the coolest classes
    * cloning a party member for a specific spell
  * selfish classes would be interesting for challenge runs like the shogun
    * needs to be vulnerable for high damage advantage state, low health damage boost
  * Encourage having multiple parties for different game modes possibly?
    * roguelike style where the floors are random, start from level 1 every time
      * unlock skill trees for each run maybe?


ai suggestions:


enemy designs:

enemy types or archetypes affect what the player strategizes
- Mechanics that force the player to respond, not necessarily difficult to deal with on their own
  - in combination with other mechanics, can become lethal
- Pocket dimension where you can stack enemies (maybe 5 groups) and fight them all at once

Outside of scope but cool ideas:
- Monthly "seeds" where a certain team comp and dungeon

## Roguelike Elements
* Have fundamental "abilities" for the player to be able to have a chance at most enemies

## Allowing player to test new team comps
* Fundamentally I want the player to play around with many team comps and synergies
  * level dependent buffs and abilities
* punish same strategy over and over again



Make classes a life system
  When they die in the dungeon
